Positioning Context: Absolute positioning positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. If no positioned ancestor is found, it positions the element relative to the initial containing block, which is usually the viewport (the visible area of the web page in the browser).

Layout Flow: Elements with absolute positioning are taken out of the normal document flow. This means they do not affect the position of other elements on the page. Other elements are positioned as if the absolutely positioned element does not exist.

Coordination: Absolute positioning is set using properties like position: absolute;, top: value;, right: value;, bottom: value;, and left: value;. These values can be in pixels, percentages, or other units, defining the exact position of the element from the edges of its nearest positioned ancestor.

Relative Positioning:
Positioning Context: Relative positioning positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow. It doesn't remove the element from the document flow; it just shifts its position visually without affecting the layout of other elements.

Layout Flow: Elements with relative positioning still occupy space in the normal document flow. Other elements are positioned as if the element is still in its original position, even though it might appear visually shifted.

Coordination: Relative positioning is set using properties like position: relative;, and then you can use top: value;, right: value;, bottom: value;, and left: value; to offset the element from its normal position. The offsets are usually defined in pixels or percentages.

Key Differences:
Impact on Document Flow: Absolute positioning takes the element out of the normal document flow, whereas relative positioning keeps the element in the document flow, just visually shifting its position.

Reference Point: Absolute positioning is positioned with respect to the nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block, while relative positioning is positioned with respect to its normal position in the document flow.

Interaction with Other Elements: Elements with absolute positioning do not affect the position of other elements. Relative positioning, however, can affect the position of neighboring elements if it visually overlaps with them
